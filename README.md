# Yunomi
## A Game Engine built with Vulkan in C++

### Dependencies:
 - spdlog
 - glfw

## Building
Premake is the build system. Currently, the engine only supports windows.
After pulling down the submodules and putting all of the premake files in their necessary places, simply
run premake and everything will be set up. Then just build and run the project.
